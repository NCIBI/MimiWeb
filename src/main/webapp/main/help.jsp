			Data displayed in the MiMI website are drawn from the MiMI database, a repository that integrates data from numerous protein 
			interaction databases and other external biological sources. MiMI also includes text-mined data from NCIBI-based natural language 
			processing of PubMed literature. Much of the data in MiMI comes from curated sources.

				<div class="itemSubTitle">Start Your Search</div>
				To perform a basic search, simply enter a single keyword, human gene symbol, or Entrez gene id into the search box at the top of the page. 
				If your search is more complex than this, or involves an organism other than human, one can do an Advanced Search by clicking the "Search" link.<br/>
				The following options are available for an Advanced Search:
				<ul>
					<li>'Full Text' - Search by keywords, genes, diseases, or strings of genes.</li>
					<li>'List' - Search with a list of genes or compounds by symbol or ID.</li>
					<li>'Gene Interaction' - Search for specific gene interactions.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				In Full Text Search, use any phrases or operators permitted by Lucene (See <a href="#samples">below</a> 
				for example queries). Specify if you want MiMI to search for your terms in only certain fields by 
				adding the <a href="#fields">field prefix</a> : cellularComponent:nucleus. 
				(For gene lists, click the radio button to specify names or ID, upload a file and copy it if you are using a file).
				For more detailed instructions for using Lucene queries visit: <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html">
				http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_0/queryparsersyntax.html</a> 
				</p>
				<p>
				In List Search, enter a list of multiple gene or compound IDs/symbols to search for. 
				Acceptable input types include Entrez gene IDs, gene symbols, or KEGG compound IDs.  
				Be sure to select the correct type for your input (Genes or Compounds).
				</p>
				<p>
				In Gene Interaction Search, specify a pair of Entrez gene IDs or gene symbols to search for protein interactions involving the gene pair. 
				Acceptable input types include Entrez gene IDs, gene symbols, or KEGG compound IDs.

				<div class="itemSubTitle">Sample MiMI Queries</div>
				<ul>				
					<li>If you are interested in any gene that references insulin you can type in: <span>insulin</span></li>
					<li>To find genes with both insulin and receptor in them: <span>insulin AND receptor</span></li>
					<li>Note: The AND (and the OR, below) must be in upper-case letters.</li>
					<li>To find genes with the phrase "insulin receptor" surround the word in double quotes: <span>"insulin receptor"</span></li>
					<br>
					<li>To limit your "insulin receptor" search to homo sapiens, but you are not sure how to spell homo sapiens use the * wildcard: 
					<span>insulin receptor" AND organism:homo*</span></li>
					<li>To find genes that interact in the nucleus you can query by field name: <span>cellularComponent:nucleus</span></li>
					<li>To find genes that interact in the nucleus for either humans or fruit flies, and you cannot remember the spelling of either 
					organism:
						<ul>
							<li><span>cellularComponent:nucleus AND (organism:homo* OR organism:dro*)</span></li>
						</ul>					
					</li>
					<li>Even more fun: to look for genes that interact in the nucleus, for either humans or fruit flys, that specifically reference 
					insulin receptor:
						<ul> 
							<li><span>"insulin receptor" AND cellularComponent:nucleus AND (organism:homo* OR organism:dro*)</span></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>For a gene with a specific Entrez Gene ID, you can use the term geneid, for example search for <span>geneid:1436</span>.
				</ul>
				Of course, you can still type in and search on gene symbols or Entrez gene IDs.
