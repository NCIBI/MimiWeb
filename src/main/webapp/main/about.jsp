				<p>MiMI (Michigan Molecular Interactions) is part of the NIH's <a href="http://www.ncibi.org">
				National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics</a> (NCIBI).</p>
				<p>MiMI provides access to the knowledge and data merged and integrated from numerous protein interactions databases. 
				It augments this information from many other biological sources. MiMI merges data from these sources with "deep integration" 
				(see <a href="#merge">The MiMI Merge Process</a> section) into its single database. A simple yet powerful user interface 
				enables you to query the database, freeing you from the onerous task of having to know the data format or having to learn 
				a query language. MiMI allows you to query all data, whether corroborative or contradictory, and specify which sources to 
				utilize. </p>
				<p>MiMI displays results of your queries in easy-to-browse interfaces and provides you with workspaces to explore and 
				analyze the results. Among these workspaces is an interactive network of protein-protein interactions displayed in 
				Cytoscape and accessed through MiMI via a MiMI Cytoscape plug-in. </p>
				<p>MiMI gives you access to more information than you can get from any one protein interaction source such as:</p>
				<ul>
				   <li>Vetted data on genes, attributes, interactions, literature citations, compounds, and annotated text extracts through natural language 
				   processing (NLP) </li>
				   <li>Linkouts to integrated NCIBI tools to: analyze overrepresented MeSH terms for genes of interest, read additional NLP-mined text 
				   passages, and explore interactive graphics of networks of interactions</li>
				   <li>Linkouts to PubMed and NCIBI's MiSearch interface to PubMed for better relevance rankings</li>
				   <li>Queriying by keywords, genes, lists or interactions</li>
				   <li>Provenance tracking</li>
				   <li>Quick views of missing information across databases.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em> The abstract: Molecular interaction data exists in a number of repositories, each with its own data format, molecule 
				identifier and information coverage. Michigan molecular interactions (MiMI) assists scientists searching through this 
				profusion of molecular interaction data. The original release of MiMI gathered data from well-known protein interaction 
				databases, and deep merged this information while keeping track of provenance. Based on the feedback received from users, 
				MiMI has been completely redesigned. This article describes the resulting MiMI Release 2 (MiMIr2). New functionality includes 
				extension from proteins to genes and to pathways; identification of highlighted sentences in source publications; seamless 
				two-way linkage with Cytoscape; query facilities based on MeSH/GO terms and other concepts; approximate graph matching to 
				find relevant pathways; support for querying in bulk; and a user focus-group driven interface design. MiMI is part of the

				<div class="itemSubTitle">The MiMI Merge Process</div>
				<p>Protein interaction data exists in a number of repositories. Each repository has its own data format, molecule 
				identifier, and supplementary information. MiMI assists scientists searching through this overwhelming amount of protein 
				interaction data. MiMI gathers data from well-known protein interaction databases and deep-merges the information.</p>
				<p>Utilizing an identity function, molecules that may have different identifiers but represent the same real-world object 
				are merged. Thus, MiMI allows the user to retrieve information from many different databases at once, highlighting 
				complementary and contradictory information.</p>
				<p>There are several steps needed to create the final MiMI dataset. They are:</p>
				<ol start="1" type="1">
				   <li>The original source datasets are obtained, and transformed into the MiMI schema, except KEGG, NCBI Gene, Uniprot, Ensembl.</li>
				   <li>Molecules that can be rolled into a gene are annotated to that gene record.</li>
				   <li>Using all known identifiers of a merged molecule, sources such as Organelle DB or miBLAST, are queried to annotate specific molecular fields.</li>
				   <li>The resulting dataset is loaded into a relational database.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Because this is an automated process, and no curation occurs, any errors or misnomers in the original data sources will 
				also exist in MiMI. For example, if a source indicates that the organism is unknown, MiMI will as well.</p>
				<p>If you find that a molecule has been incorrectly merged under a gene record, please contact us immediately. Because 
				MiMI is completely automatically generated, and there is no data curation, it is possible that we have merged molecules 
				with gene records incorrectly. If made aware of the error, we can and will correct the situation. Please report any problems 
				of this kind to <a href="mailto:mimi-help@umich.edu">mimi-help@umich.edu</a>.<br>
				</p>
				<h4>Rules and Assumptions</h4>
				<p>MiMI is not merged by 'experts' - everything is done automatically. When you look into genes of interest it is important 
				to understand why your target gene contains the attributes and associated annotations; you also may want to know why 
				conflicting data are displayed in the merged data. Some of the assumptions and rules that MiMI uses in deep merging that 
				may be relevant to understanding and being confident in its displays include the following:<br></p>
				<h4>Source differences in quality</h4>
				<p">Not all sources are created equal. While each source has a particular strength, each also has its drawback. Some 
				important things to know about the curation processes in these different databases that might affect your interpretations 
				and confidence include:</p>		
				<ul>
				   <li>BIND - Has a large number of interactions, many based on high-throughput data.</li>
				   <li>IntAct - Lists molecules as 'interacting' when they co-locate.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Source content</h4>
				<p>Not only do sources have different strengths and weaknesses, they also organize content differently. For example, 
				IntAct will associate publications with individual molecules while BIND associates publications with interactions only. 
				MiMI remains true to individual sources and how they assign publications to molecules or interactions.</p>
				<h4>Source data not used</h4>
				<p>In general, MiMI uses all data from each source. However, there are some data from each source that are not incorporated 
				into MiMI. For instance, sequence data is never stored within the MiMI dataset.</p>
